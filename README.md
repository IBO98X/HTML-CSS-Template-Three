# Simple HTML & CSS template

This is my third simple template made with CSS &amp; HTML only and i created this template from Osama Elzero courses so anyone want to learn from him you can click here it will open his youtube channel: [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElzeroInfo).

I noticed that this time, the third template focused on the animation property in CSS, and there were some tricks that were very useful and good practice for someone who has completed HTML and CSS courses. I truly thank Mr. Osama from the bottom of my heart for teaching so many things on his YouTube channel for free.

At the end i hope you like the design.
